# Hello, it's me.

I am a happy coder, who believes in better education and health access to all
people, and supports open source to its full extension!

Some of my main interests are: open source, education, nature, veganism and
swimming 🏊

Here I am, enjoying one amazing sunset @ Rio de Janeiro 🌇
